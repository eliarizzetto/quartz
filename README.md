# My Thesis Diary

This is the repository hosting the online version of the diary I am writing to keep track of and manage the material for my final dissertation.

The website is based on the content of markdown documents created via Obsidian and is published via Jacky Zhao's [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)

The website is still very much under development.
