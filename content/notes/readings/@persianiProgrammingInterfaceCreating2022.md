> The OpenCitations Data Model (OCDM) is a data model for bibliographic metadata and citations based on the SPAR Ontologies and developed by OpenCitations to expose all the data of its collections as sets of RDF statements compliant with an ontology named OpenCitations Ontology. In this paper, we introduce oc_ocdm, i.e. a Python library developed for creating OCDM-compliant RDF data even if the programmer has no expertise in Semantic Web technologies. After an introduction of the library and its main characteristics, we show a number of projects within the OpenCitations infrastructure that adopt it as their building block unit.
