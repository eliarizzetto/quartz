>
> The OpenCitations organization is working on ingesting citation data and bibliographic metadata directly provided by the community (e.g., scholars and publishers). The aim is to improve the general coverage of open citations, which is still far from being complete, and use the provided metadata to enrich the characterization of the citing and cited entities. This paper illustrates how the citation data and bibliographic metadata should be structured to comply with the OpenCitations accepted format.
