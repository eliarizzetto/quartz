## Summary
In this article from 2013, David Shotton presents the Open Citations Corpus (OCC).

### Citation data: its relevance and the collections

Given that reference lists and citation data are core elements of scholarly communication, as they allow the attribution of credit and the integration of independent research endeavours, these data must be readily and freely available for use by all scholars (p. 296). Although alternative metrics for impact and esteem are being developed for the significance of a research output, direct citation is still the fundamental indicator, making possible to analyse changes in the network over time, revealing patterns of communication between scholars, the development and demise of academic disciplines, etc. (p. 296)

##### Private citation collections accessible via subscription

The most authoritative sources of scholarly citation data are two commercial rivals; they are often seen as complementary, as, despite their wide coverage, neither of them is complete They are:
1.  the **Thomson Reuters Web of Science**, which grew from the Science Citation Index created by US scientist Eugene Garfield in 1964, and which was originally published by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI)
2. **Elsevier's Scopus**, born in 2004

Access to these resources costs to universities and institutions tens of thousands of pounds a year (but pricing is industrial secret and  confidential agreements makes it impossible to have certain data). Such costs represent a major obstacle for less wealthy institutions, who simply can't afford to access these data. 

##### Private citation collections accessible without subscription
Other significant sources of citation information, also run by commercial companies but accessible without subscriptions, are:
1. **Google Scholar**, released in 2004, with the widest coverage
2. **Microsoft Academic Search**, released in 2009.

> "All these sources have licence restrictions that prevent the re-publication of their citation data. For this reason, bibliometrics papers are rarely permitted to publish the data on which their conclusions are based — hampering reuse, validation of findings and other advantages of open data. Worse, the available citation data are not accurate."
> p. 296

### The Open Citations Corpus (OCC)
Given the lack of availability of citation data, the OCC was created. Shotton et al. started building it in 2010, and the first release is in mid-2011. 

> "The OCC is an **open** repository of scholarly citation data made available under a Creative Commons **public domain** dedication [...].  It aims to provide <u>accurate citation data that others may freely build upon, enhance and reuse for any purpose, without restriction under copyright or database law"</u>.
> p. 297

Up to the time of Shotton's article, the OCC provided "open access to reference lists from the 204,637 articles that then comprised the Open Access Subset of PubMed Central (OA–PMC), containing 6,325,178 individual references to 3,373,961 unique papers." (p. 297)

The data are encoded as Linked Open Data using the [**SPAR** (Semantic Publishing and Referencing) **Ontologies**](http://www.sparontologies.net/) and Semantic Web standards. 

Ideally, references will come directly from publishers at the time of article publication (and most publishers are well-inclined to the idea of putting reference lists paywall-free).


> <u>"References will be harvested centrally from [**CrossRef**](https://www.crossref.org/)</u>, the organization that provides digital object identifiers (DOI) for journal articles, to which these publishers already submit article reference lists as participants in its CitedBy Linking service. Publishers will just need to indicate their consent in the article metadata for the article’s references to be made open."
> p. 297


 
> "The long-term aim of the OCC is to **host citation information for most of the world’s scholarly literature**, in the arts and humanities as well as the sciences." 
> p. 297


In the initial idea exposed in this article, the OCC would have the potential of:
* revealing shared authorship and institutional membership, common funding and semantic relationships between articles
* providing analytical services such as search and browse tools, recommendation services, timeline visualizations, etc.
* providing a reference correction service, useful also for publishers
