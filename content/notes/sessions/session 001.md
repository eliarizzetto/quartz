> [!info]+ My goals for this session
> 
> * Start reading relevant bibliography and taking notes
> * Getting more familiar with what concerns the note-taking and notes organization processes, as well as the publication of this diary

## Readings 
The following are the readings I am starting off from, in order to get an overview of [OpenCitations](https://opencitations.net/), bibliometrics and other topics related to [Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science).

**Each reading has its own dedicated page, linked below**, containing simple bibliographic information and notes on the content of the document. The page is referenced via `citekey`, a unique, ready-to-use identifier relative to my bibliographic collection in Zotero, which I will use for the writing phase. 

You can visit [this section](https://eliarizzetto.github.io/quartz/tags/reading) of the website to see all the readings for which a page has been created so far.

#### [@shottonPublishingOpenCitations2013](notes/readings/@shottonPublishingOpenCitations2013.md)

In this article Shotton presents the OCC and its expected development, after a brief overview on other providers of reference lists and the scientific relevance of citation data.

#### [@heibiCrowdsourcingOpenCitations2019](notes/readings/@heibiCrowdsourcingOpenCitations2019.md)

After an analysis of the data in COCI, guided by 3 research questions revolving around the openness of citations and the publisher's role, the authors propose a new, crowdsourced index, for OpenCitations: CROCI. 

#### [@heibiSoftwareReviewCOCI2019](notes/readings/@heibiSoftwareReviewCOCI2019.md)

The authors present COCI and its features (citations as first-class data entities, OCI identifier), the extended OpenCitations Data Model, the ingestion workflow for COCI and some statistics, use cases and tools related to this Index.

The most complete and up-to-date resource on the OpenCitations infrastructure, summarizing the other readings on the topic. This paper describes OpenCitations and its data sets, tools, services, and activities. These include the Data Model; the SPAR Ontologies; OpenCitationsâ€™ open software of generic applicability for searching, browsing, and providing REST APIs over RDF triplestores; OCIs and the OCI Resolution Service; the OpenCitations Corpus (OCC), a database of open downloadable bibliographic and citation data (in RDF and under CC0); and the OpenCitations Indexes of open citation data, of which the first and largest is COCI.

#### [@massariHowStructureCitations2022](notes/readings/@massariHowStructureCitations2022.md)

This paper describes the syntax of the CSV files for crowdsourced metadata (META-CSV) and citation data (CITS-CSV), providing examples (see appendix). A more exhaustive documentation of the aforementioned syntax is provided at [@massariarcangeloHowProduceWellformed2022a](notes/readings/@massariarcangeloHowProduceWellformed2022a.md).
