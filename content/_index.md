## About this website üìì

This website hosts the diary I am writing to keep track of the progress and manage all useful material in researching for my masters' thesis.

I will create a page:
* for each "work session", i.e. a period of time dedicated to specific readings, tasks, problems to be solved, goals, etc.
* for each meeting with my supervisor
* for each relevant reading
* for single concepts, insights and ideas that seem to be particularly useful accross the whole process of preparing for the writing phase and for the writing phase itself

The notes (pages) are organized in a "hybrid" structure, sort of a mix between a classic diary, with its events in chronological order, and a graph-like [zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), that allows me to easily connect concepts, activities and events without being restricted to the sequential structure of the diary.


## Index of Work Sessions and Meetings

Below, you can find an Index of **all the work sessions and the meetings**, which will often be related, at least partially, both temporally and content-wise. 


| **Sessions** | **Meetings** |

## Readings

If you're interested in getting an overview of the **readings** I have collected so far, you can visit [this section](https://eliarizzetto.github.io/quartz/tags/reading) of the website. Each reading has its own dedicated page, containing simple bibliographic information and notes on the content of the document. The page is referenced via `citekey`, a unique, ready-to-use identifier relative to my bibliographic collection in Zotero, which I will use for the writing phase.
