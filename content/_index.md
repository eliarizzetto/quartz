title: "Thesis diary"

This is my first try publishing markdown files (originally created in Obsidian) as a website.

[let's see if this works](\thesis_diary\link esempio.md)

or if [this](\thesis_diary\link20%esempio.md) works (it's the same but the address is encoded with `20%` instead of a whitespace)

It would be great if [this](\thesis_diary\tryout.md) worked as well.
