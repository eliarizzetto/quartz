title: "My Thesis Diary"
---

This website hosts the diary I am writing to keep track of the progress and manage all useful material in researching for my masters' thesis.

Let's see if [this link](/thesis_diary/prova1.md) works.

It would be great if [this](thesis_diary/tryout.md) worked as well. 

This is a wikilink for the page [[thesis_diary/tryout]], let's see if it works.

One day, this page will be a proper *index*, i.e. it will be linking to different sections or folders, and for each of them to different weeks and days, so as to track every minimal progress in time.
E.g. (these links do not correspond to any page):

* [[Meetings]]
* [[Readings]]
* [notes](content/notes)


Here there could be also a nice **timeline** or a sort of calendar widget.
