title: "Thesis diary"

This is my first try publishing markdown files (originally created in Obsidian) as a website.

Let's see if [this link](\thesis_diary\prova1.md) works.

It would be great if [this](\thesis_diary\tryout.md) worked as well. 

One day, this page will be a proper *index*, i.e. it will be linking to different sections or folders, and for each of them to different weeks and days, so as to track every minimal progress in time.
E.g. (these links do not correspond to any page):

* [[Meetings]]
* [[Readings]]
* [[Notes]]

Here there could be also a nice **timeline** or a sort of calendar widget.
