This website hosts the diary I am writing to keep track of the progress and manage all useful material in researching for my masters' thesis.


This is a wikilink for the page [[notes/tryout]], let's see if it works.

Take me to the [Meetings Index](notes/Meetings%20Index)

Take me to the [Sessions  Index](notes/Sessions%20Index)



Here there could be also a nice **timeline** or a sort of calendar widget.
