# Meetings
This page should work a bit like an index for all the resources and notes collected during the weekly meetings with my supervisor. 
I still must decide whether: 
* to create a single markdown note for each meeting, 
* or simply take notes of each new meeting in a corresponding new section of one document.
In the first case, the current document might be a sort of ToC linking to different "isolated" notes saved somewhere else in a yet-to-be-created folder; in the second case, all the meeting notes would be on this page, each in its own section of this document, and all the sections would be referenced as links (with "#") in the automatically created ToC at the top of the page.
One advantage of the first approach is that i don't have to manually update an "index" file each time I add notes for a meeting, plus I can maintain the graph-oriented approach of Obsidian and Zettelkasten, and finally I can easily create a template to use for every new meeting note. The second approach, on the contrary, allows me to have everything on a single page (more readability but no graph structure) and to let the ToC update itself; but I can't use templates with the 2nd approach.
